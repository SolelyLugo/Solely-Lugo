<p> <b> Where do you see yourself in two years? </b> <p>
<p> In two years I see myself in a university or college studing computer science and software engineering. If I could choose, I would choose Massachusetts Institute of Technology [MIT] since it is my dream university. I would also most likely be hosting a basic retail or fast food job in order to make extra funds for college and/or living spaces. </p>

<p> <b> Where do you see yourself in five years? </b> <p>
<p> In five years I see myself holding an internship relating to coding/software development in a company similiar to DTE or Google. Or I see myself holding a full-time job at a technological company as an IT or Software Engineer at a similiar DTE or Google company. I would also like to have my own aparment or living space at that time while being able to support myself financially.</p>

<p> <b> How will you get there? </b> <p>
<p> I will get there by doing everything possible to have a fufilling highscool career. What I mean by this is that I will do my absolutw best to get as much experience as I can get using summer programs such GDYT, Upward Bound, and Summer AP Classes. I will also make sure in the school year I maintain a 3.5 GPA in my Junior and Senior year. This will help build the best possible transcript that colleges would see. </p>
